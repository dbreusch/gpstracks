# GPS Tracks
A GPS track viewer and manager web app.

Draws heavily from Udemy course on React, Node, Express and more but integrates
it all into a new, custom MERN application.

## Organization

This app is split into multiple pieces:
* gpstracks: the main organizing component
* [auth-api](https://github.com/dbreusch/auth-api): a Node submodule handling user authorization
* [users-api](https://github.com/dbreusch/users-api): a Node submodule for managing users
* [frontend](https://github.com/dbreusch/gpstracks-frontend): a React app (and submodule) implementing the UI
